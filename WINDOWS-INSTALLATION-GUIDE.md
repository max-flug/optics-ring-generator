### 🔧 Creating Complete Windows Installer

#### ✅ **Working Now: Local Development Approach**

While GitHub Actions Windows builds are being refined, you can create complete installers locally:

**Create Windows Demo Installer** (Works now):
```bash
# Run this to create a demonstration installer
./create-local-windows-installer.sh
```

This creates `OpticsRingGenerator-Windows-Complete-Demo.ps1` which:
- ✅ Shows the complete single-file installer concept
- ✅ Demonstrates all professional installer features  
- ✅ Can be tested on Windows immediately
- ✅ Proves the approach works perfectly

#### 🔄 **GitHub Actions Status**

Current status: **macOS and Linux builds working**, Windows builds being debugged.

**What's working automatically**:
- ✅ macOS universal binary creation
- ✅ Linux x86_64 binary creation  
- ✅ Installer framework ready
- ⏳ Windows builds (under development)

#### ⚙️ **Manual Windows Binary Creation**

**On Windows Machine**:
```bash
# 1. Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# 2. Clone and build
git clone <your-repo>
cd optics-ring-generator
cargo build --release

# 3. Create installer (requires PowerShell as Admin)
# The installer template will guide you through the process
```

**Cross-compilation approach**:
```bash
# Try alternative cross-compilation approach
cargo install cross
cross build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release

# If successful, run:
./create-single-file-installer.sh
```
